# CLI
Quickly build interactive Command line applications in PHP with 0 effort.

## Installation
`composer install b-hayes/cli`

## Usage.
Simply define a PHP class and inject it into the CLI wrapper üòé.
```php
(new \BHayes\CLI\CLI( $yourClass ))->run();
```
All your public class methods are now available as terminal commands.

Now you can just build your class methods instead of managing the interface. üëç

### Getting started.
For those unfamiliar with command line scripts...
Make a file with a shebang line (#!) at the top that tells your shell to run this with php.

```php
#!/usr/bin/env php
<?php //        üëÜ important üëá 
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';
//just using anonymous class as a quick example, can be any class.
$yourClass = new Class() {
    function hello(int $number = 0) {
        if ($number) return "You gave me the number $number";
        return 'Hi ' . \BHayes\CLI\CLI::prompt('Enter your name', `git config user.name`);
    }
};

(new \BHayes\CLI\CLI( $yourClass ))->run();
```

Next make the file executable:
```chmod +x myAwesomeNewCliApp```

Now you can run it as a terminal application!
```
./myAwesomeNewCliApp
```
CLI will guide the terminal user how to run the available methods of your class.

#### Windows
For those in windows who want to use powershell/cmd you will have to also make a batch file int he same locaiton:
```cmd
php %~dp0/myAwesomeNewCliApp -- %*
```
#### Start a collection.
I recommend keeping these files in a `/bin` folder in a personal project where
all your awesome CLI applications will live
and use git to synchronize them across your computers. üòâ

## Behaviours.
Here is what happens when CLI runs your class object.

- Public methods of your Class become executable commands.
- Automatic usage messages guiding the user how to execute your class methods.
- Anything returned by a method is printed and no output is suppressed.
- Required methods parameters will be enforced.
- Scalar data types for method parameters will be enforced (try it).
- Prevents user from passing too many arguments unless method is explicitly variadic. (Php allows it but I dont.)
- Help `--help` option will display your doc blocks if you have them.
- Public vars/properties of your class become options/flags.
- Anonymous classes work
- Dynamically added functions do not work. (intentional)
- If you do not inject your own class then CLI will run itself making its own methods available to the terminal.

### Errors and Exceptions
All errors are caught and suppressed with a generic error message
unless debug mode is used (see debug mode).
However, there is a set of UserResponse exceptions for when you just
want to terminate the app quickly with a message for the user to read.

CLI also detects and adjusts the default php error reporting config to prevent errors spitting output to the
terminal twice in debug mode.

### Responses to the user.
You can display messages to the user however you want:
 - by echoing strings yourself and exiting manually.
 - by returning a string, array or anything else to print.
 - by throwing a UserResponse exceptions.

I recommend using the provided UserResponse exception family for errors,
so dont have to print the mesage with a new line and then exit with a non
zero code manually.
```php
throw new \BHayes\CLI\UserResponse('This has exit code 1 and no coloured output');
throw new \BHayes\CLI\UserErrorResponse('Exit code 1 and text is printed in RED');
throw new \BHayes\CLI\UserWarningResponse('Exit code 1 and text is printed in YELLOW');
//all responses have an exit code of 1 by default except this one üëá
throw new \BHayes\CLI\UserSuccessResponse('Exit code 0 and text is printed in GREEN');
```

### Options/Flags
Based on the [POSIX](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argument-Syntax.html)
standard CLI support short options `-o` and long options `--longOption`.

Options are mapped to public class variables defined in your class.
EG. If you want to have a --cats option for cats mode simply define the property
`public cats` and then simply check if it's true.
```php
if($this->cats) { echo "Cat mode enabled!"; }
```

*Note CLI currently does not support options with arguments (planned for php7.4 and higher).*

#### Reserved Options.
CLI has reserved some options.
 - --help. Just prints related doc blocks and exits without running your class.
 - --debug. Debug mode, if enabled no exceptions/errors are suppressed.
   Your app can still use the debug option for its own purposes too.
 - -i does nothing but can not be used by your app.
   I have reserved it for "interactive mode" that I am thinking about building.

## Examples.

Save this example as a `testme` file and make it executable `chmod +x ./testme` and run with `./testme`

Play with this to see a showcase of how type hinting dock blocks required and optional params
user prompts and different outputs etc are used.

```php
#!/usr/bin/env php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);//optional but good practice IMO. Google it.

use BHayes\CLI\UserResponse;

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php'; //if installed via composer

/**
 * This is the documentation that will appear when you type --help.
 */
class Example {

    /**
    * This one is easy to run.
    * try runMe with --help to see this text. 
    */
    public function runMe(string $optional = null) {
        //either return output or just output directly its up to you.
        echo "I work with no arguments.";
        if ($optional !== null) {
            echo " But thanks for providing me with: ";
            var_dump($optional);
        }
    }
    
    /**
    * This command will only run when all the requirements are met.
    */
    public function tryMe(bool $bool, string $string, float $float, int $int) {
        return "You did it! You gave me bool a string, a float and an int.";
    }
    
    /**
     * This method will accept any number of string arguments while the
     * the others will fail if you pass them too many arguments.
     *
     * @param string ...$bunchOfStrings
    */
    public function variadic (string ...$bunchOfStrings){
        echo "You said ";
        if (empty($bunchOfStrings)) {echo "nothing.";}
        print_r($bunchOfStrings);
        echo "\n";
    }
    
    /**
    * Demos prompts.
    * 
    * @throws UserResponse
    */
    public function survey():string {
        if (! \BHayes\CLI\CLI::confirm('Shall we begin?')) {return "Cancelled";}
        $colour = \BHayes\CLI\CLI::prompt('Whats your favorite colour?');
        throw new UserResponse("I love $colour too!",$colour, '‚ò∫');
    }
    
    
    /**
    * Tests the UserResponse throwable. 
    *
    * @param bool|null $success
    * @throws UserResponse
    */
    public function throwsUserResponse(bool $success = null){
        if($success === true) {
            throw new \BHayes\CLI\UserSuccessResponse();//all params optional
        }
        if($success === false) {
            throw new \BHayes\CLI\UserErrorResponse('Some error message user needs to see!');
        }
        throw new UserResponse('Try this again with true or false.');
    }
    
     /**
     * foo is now an option because it has been declared public. 
     * @var bool 
     */
    public $foo = false;
    
    /**
    * Run me with and without `--foo` and see the result.
    */
    public  function bar()
    {
        var_dump($this->foo);
    }
};

$cli = new BHayes\CLI\CLI(new Example());
$cli->run();
```

## Advanced options.
###Forced debug mode.
During development, you may wish to always run in debug mode without typing --debug.
```php
$cli->run(true);
```
Or you may wish to prevent debug mode from working at all
WARNING: Doing this disables the --debug option as it if never exited.
So if the user types --debug now the applicaiton wont run because its an invalid option.


If you DO want both CLI and your class to receive the debug option by default simply 
add to the global argv before it runs.
```php
global $argv; //this is a built in var where php puts command line inputs
$argv[] = '--debug'; //manually add the --debug input as if the user typed it
$cli->run();
```

You can also prevent the debug option form working on cli by specifying false in the run method.
This means --debug option has no effect but can still be used 
```php
$argv[] = '--debug'; //this will get passed to your application but have no effect on CLI
$cli->run(false);//because debug has been explicitly disabled at run time.
```

### Custom exceptions for user responses.
For many reasons, you may prefer avoid your class being dependent on CLI UserResponse exceptions,
but want to throw exceptions with messages the user should read.

You can give CLI a list of custom response exception types before it runs.
```php
$cli->setCustomResponseExceptions( MySpecialUserException::class, MyOtherException::class );
```
These and any Exceptions that inherit them will be treated the same UserResponse exceptions,
however the exit code will not be used if it is 0.

This is because exceptions the default code of \Exception is 0 and nobody thinks about
them potentially getting used as exit codes when building a php application.

So I have forced non 0 exit codes for all except CLI's UserResponse exceptions,
since with those you must explicitly throw a success code.

### Force exit with 0.
For whatever reason, you may want your app to always return 0.
Simply force debug mode and exit manually in a try catch.

```php
try{
    $cli->run(true);
    } catch(Throwable $e) {
    //do your logging or special handling etc.
    exit(0);//and then exit with 0 manually.
    }
```
